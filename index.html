<h1>James Payne Homepage</h1>
<p>
    This is my homepage, here I've got a few interesting links to some cool
    engineering and science things, primarily talking about space and cubesats.
    After I have a Resume section and some cool things I've learned from my 
    classes I've experienced so far.
</p>
<h2>Cool Space and Engineering Stuff</h2>
<p>
    A cubesat is a standardized system for making miniature satellites, popular
    for use in things like research or university projects, they are generally
    very cheap by comparison to more specifically designed satellites. Here I 
    have provided a few links to places to learn more, NASA and Hack-A-Sat's 
    pages talking about the subject. Hack-A-Sat is particularlly cool since 
    its a 'hackathon in space' where a cubesat was launched up and people 
    competed in hacking it in a game of hacker capture the flag.
